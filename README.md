This project leverages Genetic Algorithms to optimize betting strategies for football matches, focusing on player-related events such as fouls, goals, cards, and shots on target. By analyzing historical player performance data, the model suggests optimal betting combinations to maximize potential returns while considering constraints like budget and betting odds. Key features include population-based optimization, fitness calculations, and selection mechanisms to generate high-value betting strategies. The approach highlights data-driven decision-making and showcases practical applications of optimization techniques in sports betting. Despite limitations like data dependencies and inherent sports unpredictability, the model demonstrates the power of genetic optimization for complex real-world problems.
